Throughout this project what i have to do:
1. Generate gaussian kernel with given kernel size and sigma value.
2. Implementation of Gaussian blur with the generated gaussian kernel.
3. DOG (Difference oof gaussian) image generation
4. Maxima-Minima point detection
5. Blob detection with calculated radious.
